                    <article>
                        <p>
                            The School is located at Ntowkrom, a village in Ayensuano District in the Eastern region of
                            Ghana. It was started as a private primary school by a native of the village called Opanyin
                            Ansah.
                            It was absorbed by the government (Ghana Education Service) in 1956.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was first called Sunsumamu L/A Primary and later in 2010, the name was changed to
                            Ntowkrom D/A
                            Primary.
                            The Junior High School department was started in 2014 and the school became known as
                            Ntowkrom D/A
                            Basic.
